### Open ID Connect configuration

The section **Oidc** configures the OpenID Connect server, required by Amplia for user management. For now, leave the setting
**Enabled** as `false` and use the root password to authenticate. Later, see [Configure OpenID Connect](../configure-oidc.md)
if you want to enable user management.
