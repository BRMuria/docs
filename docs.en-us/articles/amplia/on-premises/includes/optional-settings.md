### Optional settings

We recommend leaving the following sections with **Enabled** as `false` for now. Once you get Amplia running,
you can see each link below to enable optional features:

* **Email**: configures email sending. To enable this feature, see [Configure email sending](../configure-email.md).
* **Oidc**: configures OpenID Connect integration, required for user management.
  To enable this feature, see [Configure OpenID Connect](../configure-oidc.md).
* **SMS**: configures SMS sending, required for the SMS confirmation during the end-user certificate issuing
  procedure. To enable this feature, see [Configure SMS sending](../configure-sms.md)
