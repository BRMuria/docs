### Optional settings

We recommend leaving the remaining sections unchanged for now. Once you get Amplia up and running, you can see
each link below to enable optional features:

* [HTTPS redirection](../configure-https-redirect.md)
* [Email sending](../configure-email.md)
* [OpenID Connect integration](../configure-email.md) (required for user management)
* [SMS sending](../configure-sms.md) (required for the end-user certificate issuing page)
