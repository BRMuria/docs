## Installation Package Overview

An installation package named `grantid-<version_number>.zip` will be made available whenever you need to install/update GrantID.

GrantID is composed by 3 components:

1. **IdentityService**: REST service that must have access the a Database.
1. **AuthServer**: OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect autorization server.
1. **Console**: console interface to setup applications.

The components may be installed in different servers or in the same, according to your needs, once the following requirements are met:

* The AuthServer must have network access to the IdentityService.
* The Console must have network access to the IdentityService. It does not need explicit network access to the AuthServer, but it may redirect an user to it, as all logins/registrations are handled by the AuthServer.
* The IdentityService must be updated before the other two components, since they rely on it's APIs.

Package folder structure:

* Tools: contains binaries that may be used to generate certificates and keys. Requires <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=42642" target="_blank">NET Framework 4.5.2</a> to run.
* Keys: contains the development certificate and key.
* Config: contains the configuration files used to setup the components.
* Components: contains the binaries of all the components.

## Installation Package Setup

1. Create a working directory, for example: `C:\GrantId-Install`
1. Unzip the installation package into a subfolder with the same name as the package (in the working directory).
1. When installing to a production environment for the first time, it is strongly advised to replace the key and certificate found in the Keys directory of the unzipped installation package.
   1. The `GrantID.pfx` certificate will be used to sign application tokens issued by GrantID. To generate a new certificate navigate to the Tools Folder use the command bellow:
```ps
grantid.exe gencert <nome do certificado>
```
   Example:
```ps
grantid.exe gencert "GrantID Company X"
```
   Move the generated file to the Keys folder. The file is generated with the same name as the one already present in the Keys folder so it will be overwritten.
   1. The `key.xml` is used to protect cookies and secrets generated by GrantID. Use the same utility used in the certificate generation steps with a different argument:
```ps
grantid.exe genkey [diretório de saída]
```
   Example:
```ps
grantid.exe genkey “C:\Keys”
```
   Move the generated file to the Keys folder. The file is generated with the same name as the one already present in the Keys folder so it will be overwritten.
