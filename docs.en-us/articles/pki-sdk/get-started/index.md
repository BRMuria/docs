# Get started

To start using the Lacuna PKI SDK, you will need to follow these instructions:

* [Adding the nuget package](nuget.md)
* [Licensing](licensing.md)

By the end of this process, you should have been able to add the Lacuna PKI SDK package to your project and must have configured the SDK license. Here's how to use the SDK by going to the next topics like [Certificates](../certificates/index.md) e [Signatures](../signatures/index.md).
