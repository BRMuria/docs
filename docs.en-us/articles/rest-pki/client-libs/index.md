# Rest PKI client libraries

Even though Rest PKI exposes REST APIs which are easily consumable, they are not intended to be used directly. Instead, we
provide client libraries for serveral programming languages, so that programmers do not need to worry about the details
involved in caliing APIs, and instead write code in their favorite language.

Client libraries are available for the following programming languages:

* [PHP](php.md)
* [Java](java.md)
* [.NET](dotnet.md) (C#, Visual Basic.NET, etc)
* [Python](python.md)
* [NodeJS](nodejs.md)
