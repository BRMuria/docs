# Rest PKI Core

**Rest PKI Core** is an upcoming version of [Rest PKI](../index.md) that will have extended compatibility with environments and databases.

In addition to Windows Server (which is already supported by Rest PKI), Rest PKI Core also runs on **Linux** (Debian- and RedHat-based distributions)
and on **Docker**. As for database servers, in addition to SQL Server, **PostgreSQL** is also supported.

## Roadmap and Rest PKI compatibility

Versions 1.x of Rest PKI Core will have some, but not all, of the features currently available on Rest PKI 1.x (plus some additional features of its own).
As versions 1.x of Rest PKI Core progress, more and more features avaliable on Rest PKI will become available. When Rest PKI Core reaches full compatibility
with Rest PKI, version 2.0 will be released, unifiying both modules and being simply called *Rest PKI 2*, expected to be released sometime around the second
semester of 2021.
