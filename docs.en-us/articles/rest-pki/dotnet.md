# Using Rest PKI on .NET

We are still migrating the documentation to the new unified portal. For now, please[see this article on GitHub](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestPkiSamples/tree/master/CSharp) 
## Client lib

The client lib for .NET (C# and Visual Basic .NET) consists of the Nuget package [Lacuna.RestPki.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Lacuna.RestPki.Client/). The following platforms are supported:

* .NET Standard 1.3 (for usage on .NET Core, Xamarin and UWP)
* .NET Framework 4.5
* .NET Framework 4.0
* .NET Framework 3.5

The package's dependencies are all owned by either Microsoft or Lacuna Software itself. No 3rd party packages are necessary (except for the [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json/) package, the de-facto standard for handling JSON on .NET)

See the [API reference](xref:Lacuna.RestPki.Client).
