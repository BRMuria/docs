# Rest PKI on-premises

If for any reason you can't or won't use a cloud service, you can also host your own instance of [Rest PKI](../index.md) on your
premises. See the [product's commercial information](https://www.lacunasoftware.com/en/home/certificate#/rest) for more
details.

## Supported platforms

Rest PKI is compatible with:

* [Windows Server](windows-setup/index.md)
* [Azure App Service](azure-setup.md)

> [!NOTE]
> For Linux environments, we recommend using [PKI Express](../../pki-express/index.md) instead

Click on one of the platforms above for specific setup instructions.
