# Using Rest PKI on PHP 5.2

We are still migrating the documentation to the new unified portal. For now, please[see this article on GitHub](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestPkiSamples/tree/master/PHP#legacy-sample-for-php-52)## Client libFor PHP 5.2, use the file [RestPkiLegacy52.php](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestPkiSamples/blob/master/PHP/legacy52/RestPkiLegacy52.php). It requires the
package [educoder/pest](https://packagist.org/packages/educoder/pest), which needs to be added to your `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "educoder/pest": "1.0.0"
    }
}
```
