# Using Rest PKI on Python

Rest PKI can be used on Python. To get started, see the [Python/Flask samples project](flask.md).

## Client library

The Python/Flask sample project uses the PyPi package [restpki-cient](https://pypi.org/project/restpki-client/) to access Rest PKI on Python applications. It supports Python 2 and Python 3.


To add it to your project, put `restpki-client==1.0.0` on your `requirements.txt` file or install with `pip install restpki-client`.

> If you don't have **pip** installed, get it [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

### Source code

The package is open-source, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestPkiPythonClient). Feel free to fork the package if you need to make any customizations.
