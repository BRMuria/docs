# Using Rest PKI on Ruby

Rest PKI can be used on Ruby. To get started, see the [Ruby on Rails samples project](rails.md).

## Client library

To use Rest PKI on Ruby applications, use our **Ruby Gem** [rest_pki](https://rubygems.org/gems/rest_pki)
by declaring on your `Gemfile`:

```gemspec
gem 'rest_pki', '~> 1.0.0'
```

After that, do a `bundle install` to download the gem and its dependencies (if you don't have Bundler installed,
get it [here](http://bundler.io/))

Alternatively, you can install the gem directly on command-line:

```
gem install rest_pki
```

The gem is open-source, hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/LacunaSoftware/RestPkiRubyClient). Feel free to
fork it if you need to make any customizations.
