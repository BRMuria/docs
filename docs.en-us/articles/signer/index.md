## Characteristics

* **Signatures with legal validity**: Signer performs digital and electronic signatures of documents such as proxies, commercial proposals, contracts and medical reports.
* **Each client with its own instance**: Signer instances, their databases and storage, are individual, this means more control in a more personalized environment.

## *On premises*

As mentioned above, Signer can be used in the cloud (modality SaaS, in [dropsigner.com](https://www.dropsigner.com/)) or you can have your own instance ("on premises"). See the article [Signer *on premises*](on-premises/index.md) for more informations.
