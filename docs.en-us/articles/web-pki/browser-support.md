¹ Although Microsoft has added partial support on Edge for browser extensions, not all necessary APIs are currently available. Specifically
a critical API for Web PKI called native messaging is still unsupported, but
[Microsoft has said it will implement it soon](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/platform/issues/8984919/).
We're commited to support Microsoft Edge as soon as that happens.
