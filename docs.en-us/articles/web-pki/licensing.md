# Licensing

In order to be able to use the component in web pages outside of localhost, you'll first need to [acquire a license](https://www.lacunasoftware.com/en/home/certificate#/webPlans).
Licensing is enforced in 2 ways:

1. The domain of the website which hosts the javascript that is trying to use the component must be in the "allowed domains list" of the license;
1. The current date on the client's machine must be before the license's expiration date (you can opt for a permanent license that never expires).

Once you've purchased your license, you will receive it in two forms, such as:

```javascript
// Binary license
var myLicense = 'ASYAanNmaWRkbGUubmV0LHdlYnBraS5sYWN1bmFzb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20AAAABClKvO1J22vAD+YmfANiKQLbcLE1lNraPKCel6tRM+ZxR+h6M/crtJYRRVGGz7hrdbM0Y0mfTu15RMYGqQMi1QNZS6GrT4vNzIayv552Fl0EFWQA7jWlctUwfYoHRHVEnCNx9YGXDiA9+yDoGlVwgTR7fjzNeS3Fen1MVIyKBF464gN0JvdiCRJMI47JGVDkPmKjcrYIvJs6y5Lg25RW4ZnBKVruS+HR2s3k8ZrV4y4RCQE4UYMKbukF9vsF+JqAEifRlPq2xLcrNdxBveVDSXS/LRHAcrZrMM+Iw4A79jl0ngWPcy+CwinAhT+3dxVo5ZWMRQFpmTkylEMDvTjV9wQ==';

// Json license
var myLicense = {
  "format": 1,
  "allowedDomains": [
    // This license enables the use of the component from web pages on the following domains:
    "jsfiddle.net",
    "webpki.lacunasoftware.com"
  ],
  // This license does not expire
  "expiration": null,
  // Digital signature of the license to prevent tampering
  "signature": "ClKvO1J22vAD+YmfANiKQLbcLE1lNraPKCel6tRM+ZxR+h6M/crtJYRRVGGz7hrdbM0Y0mfTu15RMYGqQMi1QNZS6GrT4vNzIayv552Fl0EFWQA7jWlctUwfYoHRHVEnCNx9YGXDiA9+yDoGlVwgTR7fjzNeS3Fen1MVIyKBF464gN0JvdiCRJMI47JGVDkPmKjcrYIvJs6y5Lg25RW4ZnBKVruS+HR2s3k8ZrV4y4RCQE4UYMKbukF9vsF+JqAEifRlPq2xLcrNdxBveVDSXS/LRHAcrZrMM+Iw4A79jl0ngWPcy+CwinAhT+3dxVo5ZWMRQFpmTkylEMDvTjV9wQ=="
};
```

The two forms are equivalent. The difference is that the binary form hides the details of your license, while in the json form they're easily readable.
If you don't mind users who go looking into your source code to be able to see the details of your license, the json form is preferred because it makes
it easier to diagnose problems such as an expired license. However, if you'd rather hide such information, use the binary form. Please note that the
details are not encrypted in the binary form, just encoded in Base64.

Once you have your license, you must pass it in the constructor of the `LacunaWebPKI` class:

```javascript
var pki = new LacunaWebPKI('ASYAanNmaWRkbGUubmV0LHdlYnBraS5sYWN1bmFzb2Z0d2FyZS5jb20AAAABClKvO1J22vAD+YmfANiKQLbcLE1lNraPKCel6tRM+ZxR+h6M/crtJYRRVGGz7hrdbM0Y0mfTu15RMYGqQMi1QNZS6GrT4vNzIayv552Fl0EFWQA7jWlctUwfYoHRHVEnCNx9YGXDiA9+yDoGlVwgTR7fjzNeS3Fen1MVIyKBF464gN0JvdiCRJMI47JGVDkPmKjcrYIvJs6y5Lg25RW4ZnBKVruS+HR2s3k8ZrV4y4RCQE4UYMKbukF9vsF+JqAEifRlPq2xLcrNdxBveVDSXS/LRHAcrZrMM+Iw4A79jl0ngWPcy+CwinAhT+3dxVo5ZWMRQFpmTkylEMDvTjV9wQ==');
```

When running a web application hosted on localhost, the component will work even if no license is given.
