# Updates - Web PKI

[Web PKI](index.md) is automatically updated on users' computers. However, you can (and should) update the Javascript library
(`lacuna-web-pki-{version}.js`) on your web application regularly.

Updating the Javascript library:

* Fixes known issues that cannot be resolved with updates to the component installed on users' computers
* Gives your application access to new features on Web PKI

> [!TIP]
> All updates are guaranteed to be 100% backward compatible, so you can update the library without fear of breaking existing code

The latest version of the Javascript library is **2.11.0**. You can get it on the link below:
